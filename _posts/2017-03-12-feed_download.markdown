Check out the [latest episodes](https://panoptikum.social/episodes?page=1) subscribed by the Panoptikum community!

Thanks to a different HTTP-client library used by Panoptikum the quality of the automatic feed downloads has improved. The last days all feeds got checked for new episodes without a glitch (no manuell help was needed). Check out the latest episodes and travel to the future with [Guido](https://panoptikum.social/episodes/58225), [WDR5](https://panoptikum.social/episodes/89590) and [Bayern 2](https://panoptikum.social/episodes/89143) (again). Beside those three episodes with a publishing date in the future, you find up-to-date the latest episodes.

Please write regulary [recommendations](https://panoptikum.social/recommendations), regarding podcasts and episodes.

To discover podcasts outside your filter bubble use the [random function](https://panoptikum.social/recommendations/random) of Panoptikum and discover new topics.
