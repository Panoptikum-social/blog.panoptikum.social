Did you read the last blog posts and are you eager to try it out?

If you have supported Panoptikum.social with your OPML-file in the last months, then you are already registered.

But what could be your password? Use the brand new password recovery function to set your own password. Use the link [Forgot password](https://panoptikum.social/forgot_password) in the login section and enter the email address you have used to send us your file.

You should receive an email with a secure login link, don't forget to set your password once you are inside Panoptikum.social.

For those of you that are new (to us) use the link [Register](https://panoptikum.social/users/new).
