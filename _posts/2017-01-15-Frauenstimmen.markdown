The category Community now includes [Frauenstimmen](https://panoptikum.social/categories/142).

With this extension Panoptikum.social features now four Communities [Frauenstimmen](https://panoptikum.social/categories/142), [Kulturkapital - Museumspodcasts](https://panoptikum.social/categories/113), [Podcasterei](https://panoptikum.social/categories/115) and [Wissenschaftspodcast.de](https://panoptikum.social/categories/106).

The Community [Frauenstimmen](https://panoptikum.social/categories/142) includes 295 Podcasts. Nele Heises  [List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GZSUxqcLiACs94UqeDDB6t07VtvodwGqt9rMaoKsB10/edit#gid=0) provided the input. All podcasts from female voices, that should be added to her list, can be added as a comment to her [List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GZSUxqcLiACs94UqeDDB6t07VtvodwGqt9rMaoKsB10/edit#gid=0).

#### Panoptikum.social without JavaScript
Most of the features of Panoptikum.social are now working without JavaScript. There are only three points left - barcode, audioplayer and menu on small screens (mobile) - that require JavaScript.

#### Enhanced Privacy Seetings
Sharing of subscriptions and followings are now opt-in. The default setting is no sharing. There are no messages creted to subscribers and the display in the public profile depends on theprofile setting.

#### Easier Login for forgetful people
The login is now also possible with your email address. So if you are one of those people who forget their username, just use your email address.
