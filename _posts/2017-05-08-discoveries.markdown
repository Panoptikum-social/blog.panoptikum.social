Did it let you wonder what unknown world is out there?

I'd love to hear from you. Share your discoveries via a comment under this blog post, with an email to <sonja@panoptikum.io> or via Twitter.

And to something almost completely different.

I'm at the moment only two months behind with my podcast listening and heard yesterday in a [Nature Podcast](https://panoptikum.io/podcasts/215) episode about #trypod. What is your favourite podcast that you would like to recommend for first time listeners? It's not easy to select one, keeping in mind that it is for "starters": my choice #trypod [Zeitsprung](https://panoptikum.io/podcasts/84).
