Panoptikum has grown over the last months and offers much functionality.

To provide a better introduction for people who discover Panoptikum now, Stefan has implemented a tour. In the right corner there is a little bus symbol which starts the tour.

Step-by-step it leads through the Panoptikum site and its functions. From the categories (Get an overview, Select a category), the languages (Select a language, Browse a language), the podcasts (Select a podcast), the podcast page (Header Area, Subscribe, Scan to subscribe, Recommendations), the episodes (Episodes, Select an Episode), the episode page (Header Area, Show Notes, Podigee Player, Contributors) and the profile page (Profile Page, Gigs and Engagements). After 17 steps you are back to the start.

Try it out and get an overview!
