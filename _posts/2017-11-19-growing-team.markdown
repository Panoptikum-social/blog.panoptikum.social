The Panoptikum team is growing. [optikfluffel](https://github.com/optikfluffel) has already participated with more then 50 commits to the [Panoptikum project](https://github.com/PanoptikumIO/pan). Welcome!

For further interested programmers who would like to join the Panoptikum development team, Panoptikum offers a small demo data base in the materials directory in the repo to be able to onboard more quickly.

The last weeks brought several improvements

* Panoptikum stops to check for updates of a Podcast after 10 failed attempts.
* The persona of a podcaster is created automatically.
* The new podcast show view puts more focus on the episode contributors. [Check it out](https://panoptikum.social/podcasts/23963)
* Stefan updated the category Frauenstimmen. It includes now 557 podcasts.
* Find personas faster with the new search on the [personas page](https://panoptikum.social/personas). The search results are updated while you enter your search string. Often you don't need to enter your complete search string as you reach 1 entry earlier. Let's say you want to find "Waldgruber":
  * all personas 61,037 entries
  * "W" 11,928 entries (filtered from 61,037 total entries)
  * "Wa" 2,379 entries (filtered from 61,037 total entries)
  * "Wal" 463 entries (filtered from 61,037 total entries)
  * "Wald" 97 entries (filtered from 61,037 total entries)
  * "Waldg" 1 entries (filtered from 61,037 total entries)
* The claiming info in the persona show view offers now more information. There are two possible cases: persona with email address and persona without email address
