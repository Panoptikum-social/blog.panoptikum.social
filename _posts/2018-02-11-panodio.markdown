Today I want to introduce a new project [Panod.io](https://panod.io/).

[Panoptikum.io](https://panoptikum.io/) has now reached a certain level of maturity. It has a database with over 1,800,000 episodes from over 30,000 podcasts, a good user base including several pro-users, a great [API](https://blog.panoptikum.io/api/) and is growing with each uploaded OPML-file from its users and each new released episode of the podcasts listed. For the general user it offers solid functionality,

... BUT ...

for those interested in podcasts that can't read or type in a web-browser the soon 2 million episodes are not accessible. Stefan came up with the idea of Panod.io - an Android application, running on all sorts of smartphones and tablets, providing an audio-only interface for humans to access data on the acoustic web.

Check out the project page [Panod.io](https://panod.io/) - the homepage is available in English and German - for more details. Or watch the video with Ramon, Sonja and Stefan - I hope you have as much fun watching it as we had creating it: [Video](https://www.youtube.com/embed/6qM2ztyehzc?cc_lang_pref=en&cc_load_policy=1&hl=en)

As always we are quite interested what you think about it. Is it a great idea and can you think about several use-cases or do you know why we should not do it? Please let us know - mail to <sonja@panoptikum.io>
