Stefan will hold a [workshop](https://frab.das-sendezentrum.de/en/subscribe8/public/events/336) at the [SUBSCRIBE 8](http://das-sendezentrum.de/subscribe/sub8/) in Munich next Saturday.

SUBSCRIBE is a German conference for podcasters, which has its origins in the Podlove Publisher Workshops. It is a good place for podcasters and developers to come together and contribute.

Attendees of Stefan's workshop have the opportunity to give input and feedback; and influence the features and roadmap of Panoptikum in the near future.

The alpha version is (just in time) online - check it out [alpha](https://alpha.panoptikum.io).
