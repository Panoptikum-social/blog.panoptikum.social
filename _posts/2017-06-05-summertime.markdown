Search function revisited :-)

[Summertime](https://panoptikum.social/episodes/153638)!

As I am sitting on a summer morning in my "Panoptikum office" and think what to write about I searched for the word "summertime". A great variety of results is shown (and besides: it is still really FAST):

![Search Result](/img/summertime.png){:class="img-responsive"}

Really surprising was the result [The Season of Death](https://panoptikum.social/episodes/40704). I hope you have a better and safer time!

What were your weirdest search results? Please let us know.
