Interested in podcasts in different languages?

Do you have sleeping language skills that could use a wake up call? Panoptikum lists podcasts in several languages and there is also the category [Language Courses](https://panoptikum.io/categories/54). I will try it with [Podcast Francais Authentique](https://panoptikum.io/podcasts/1660), and maybe in some months I can advance to [Haute définition - La 1ère](https://panoptikum.io/podcasts/3985).

Which languages would you like to brush up before summer?
