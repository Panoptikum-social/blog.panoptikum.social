Now online available the [Panopotikum.io Workshop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAglItKATug&list=PLIoqMTM7qDWr4jEWJ0WMQAdCFDSuk-ZJo&index=23) with Stefan at SUBSCRIBE 8.

The workshop started with a short introduction to Panoptikum.social and a little background information about Stefan. This was followed by the data model of podcasts: one podcast has many episodes, episodes have several chapters and so on.

The next point was a walk through presentation of the features directly online on the Panoptikum.social [alpha site](https://panoptikum.social). After this Stefan presented the future, i.e. the roadmap. The public beta version is planned for 33C3 and the version 1.0 for summer 2017. The topics for the public beta are security, privacy, parallelization, messaging (likes, comments, recommendations) and API.

This lead to the more interactive part of the workshop with the three questions:

* How can Panoptikum.social support you as a podcaster?
* How can Panoptikum.social support you a a listener?
* What would you like to contribute as a software developer?

To follow the interesting discussion go to [Panopotikum.io Workshop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAglItKATug&list=PLIoqMTM7qDWr4jEWJ0WMQAdCFDSuk-ZJo&index=23).
