What changed in the details:

* The webplayer switched from Podlove Webplayer to [Podigee Podcast Player](https://www.podigee.com/en/podcast-hosting). This improved the stability and added the format [Opus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opus_(audio_format)) as a playable format.
* The relation between languages and podcast is now n:m instead of n:1.
* A bug was fixed which lead to missing categorizations - this added to the increase to 74 categories.
* The functional parser was rewritten based on improved design principles.
* The registration is now online. You can register yourself with username and password. The login with these credentials does work.
* For copyright reasons images, audio tags and video tags from shownotes are removed by the parser and a placeholder text is used.
* Podcasts and episodes are now listed in alphabetically order.
* The latest 5 podcasts and latest 5 episodes are prominently displayed on the alpha start page.
