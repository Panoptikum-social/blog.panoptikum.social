Panoptikum is back to using the [Podlove Web Player](https://podlove.org/podlove-web-player/) on the episode page.

Why the change back to Podlove Web Player?
* better player all together
* nicer navigation
* deep linking works again

This offers you several functions for listening to a podcast episode directly on the Panoptikum episode page:

## Chapters

You can use the chapters for navigation directly in the web player
![Kapitel](/img/podlove-kapitel.png){:class="img-responsive"}

## Share

You can share the complete episode,
![Teilen](/img/podlove-teilen.png){:class="img-responsive"}

one chapter
![Teilen](/img/podlove-teilen-kapitel.png){:class="img-responsive"}

or a minute
![Teilen](/img/podlove-teilen-minute.png){:class="img-responsive"}

## Speed and Volume

You can increase or descrese the speed and adjust the volume
