Manuals for listeners and podcasters are available now!

Panoptikum offers a wide range of functionalities. To give new users a chance to
use these two manuals are now available.

* [Listener Manual](/listener-manual)
* [Podcaster Manual](/podcaster-manual)

The listener manual describes the use of Panoptikum from the listener perspektive.
The podcaster manual describes the use of Panoptikum from the podcaster perspective.

We tried to answer the most common questions regarding the use of Panoptikum from
the last year. In the following weeks content from blog posts with more detailed
descriptions will be added to the podcaster manual.

Please send your questions regarding Panoptikum to <sonja@panoptikum.social> and help
us to write a good manual.
