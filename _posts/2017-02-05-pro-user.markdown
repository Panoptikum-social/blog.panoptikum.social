Panoptikum offers two levels: users and pro users.

I'm sure it doesn't come unexpected that pro users get additional functions and will have to pay for that. The pro features give a user additonal possiblities around the personas. Everything around    the persons is created automatically. A pro user can improve her persona with:
* pid update
* image update
* description update: the text field supports markdown
* redirection of personas
* delegation of personas

Check out this example of the persona of a [pro user](https://panoptikum.social/informatom) and this example of a [standard user](https://panoptikum.social/c2608c42-0e3b-554d-b4c0-5b716610e71f) to see the difference. Note the difference between the URLs.

After this intro to the pro user, let's come back to new features and improvements for all users:
* missing user image: grey person
* missing podcast image: grey podcaster
* contributions get imported
* 30x speed improvement for full text search
* episode list on podcast show view in three columns
* protection of user privacy by self hosting Ubuntu Font, Podlove Subscribe Button and Podigee Podcast Player

And to improve the user experience some house cleaning was done - mainly regarding duplicates
* remove and prevent episode duplicates
* remove duplicate chapters and enclosures
* removed duplicate content (description, summary)
* remove empty boxes
* duplicate prevention for gigs and engagements
