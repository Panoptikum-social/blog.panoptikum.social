As promised last week Stefan moved the two sites this week.

All the functionality can now be reached under https://panoptikum.io and the
blog moved to https://blog.panoptikum.io. If you are a podcaster you can now
communicate the link to your persona page at Panoptikum as the URL is stable.
The persona could become your business card as a podcaster.

Other improvements of this week
* If you misstype a persona, we give a nicer error message now.
* Fulltext search indices were broken and are now recreated
* Feed updates are now fully automatically
* https was done twice :-) -> and we are a bit faster again...

Special thanks to those who tested and sent feedback in the last days!
You helped us improving Panoptikum.
