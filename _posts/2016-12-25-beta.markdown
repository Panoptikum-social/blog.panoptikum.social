As promised beta will be online tomorrow, just in time for the 33C3.

To prepare for the wider audience some issues that should help us keep the project clear were implemented:
* Each recommendation panel now includes the link to our [complaints page](https://blog.panoptikum.social/complaints/) in the right corner. So if you want to report an offending recommendation please follow the instructions.
* The [Privacy Policy](https://blog.panoptikum.social/privacy/) was added and can be reached via the link in the footer. Future users also see the link during the [registration](https://panoptikum.social/users/new) process.

Further improvements of the last week:
* All registered users, that sent an OPML file before registration via email, can now see this file listed with the date of the email under "My OPML"
* Improved layout of "My Recommendations" and the character counter actually works now for every field ;-) ![My Recommendations](/img/recommendation_text.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}
* Alphabetic ordering of all three podcast lists in "My Podcasts"
* Name, username, email and podcaster flag can now be edited by the users themselves in "My Profile"
* Better flash message on OPML upload
* Last recommendation teaser on Alpha home page and long version on podcast show page
* Three new community driven categories: Museum Podcasts, Podcasterei (Austrian podcasting meetup) and Science Podcasts

Attendees of the 33C3: Stefan prepared a [ligthning talk](https://blog.panoptikum.social/33c3). Watch out for him (the guy with the Panoptikum.social hoodie) and get stickers!
