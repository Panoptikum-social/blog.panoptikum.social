I am sure you noticed that the order of the search results got better last week :-)

The improved search and the massive amount of categories, podcasts and episodes within Panoptikum lead to a new problem. The search result was quite long and unclear.

What would you like to see first? I guess most of us you would answer with "show the most important first".

That's exactly what Stefan implemented this week. If one enters a search string, the results are weighted in the following order: Categories, Podcasts, Persons, Episodes and Users. This leads to a clearer presentation of the search results. If the search string is for instance "Aua-uff-code" the first search result is the podcast, second is the persona followed by episodes.

What I still really find cool is the speed of the search. In the example above 6480 results in 0.348 seconds! I think this really invites user to explore Panoptikum for podcasts using the search function.
