User Self Service regarding Personas is online.

It is possible to edit the Persona master data. Delegation and redirection is available.

* Delegation: A delegation lets the gigs (i.e. contributions to episodes) and engagements (i.e. contributions to podcasts) of the persona also appear on the profile page of the target persona.
* Redirection: The redirection redirects the persona profile page to the profile page of the target persona.

Why do we need Personas? Each podcast episode has only one author. If this author is actually a group of people, they are listed together and form then a new identity. Let's say "Max and Moritz" are the author of the podcast "Lausbubenstreiche", Max is the author of the podcast "Max, his point of view" and Moritz is the author of the podcast "Moritz - the untold stories". In this case we have 3 Persons: "Max and Moritz", "Max" and "Moritz".

The persons are setup automatically based on the author information in the feeds. Coming back to Max and Moritz, the Personas are created and afterwards Max stumbles over Panoptikum.io. He registers himself as "Max Busch", sets "I am a podcaster myself" and now wants to set the connection between himself and the Persons. This claiming of the Persona is done via email.

He claims both Personas ("Max", "Max and Moritz"). Claiming creates emails to the emails addresses used in the feeds. He confirms the ownership via links in the email. After the successful claiming he can delegate "Max and Moritz" to "Max".

Some years ago Max produced another podcast using his nickname Maxi. Now he wants to get rid of his old identity and delegates and redirects the Persona Maxi to the Persona Max.

A real world example is shown in the following diagram

**And now to the part where YOU can do something: claim YOUR Personas!**
