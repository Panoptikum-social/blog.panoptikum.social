User Self Service regarding Personas is online.

It is possible to edit the Persona master data. Delegation and redirection is available.

* Delegation: A delegation lets the gigs (i.e. contributions to episodes) and engagements (i.e. contributions to podcasts) of the persona also appear on the profile page of the target persona.
* Redirection: The redirection redirects the persona profile page to the profile page of the target persona.

Why do we need Personas? Each podcast episode has only one author. If this author is actually a group of people, they are listed together and form then a new identity. Let's say "Max and Moritz" are the author of the podcast "Lausbubenstreiche", Max is the author of the podcast "Max, his point of view" and Moritz is the author of the podcast "Moritz - the untold stories". In this case we have 3 Persons: "Max and Moritz", "Max" and "Moritz".

The persons are setup automatically based on the author information in the feeds. Coming back to Max and Moritz, the Personas are created and afterwards Max stumbles over Panoptikum.io. He registers himself as "Max Busch", sets "I am a podcaster myself" and now wants to set the connection between himself and the Persons. This claiming of the persona is done via email.

He claims the Persona "Max" and delegates "Max and Moritz" to "Max".

or MIf a Panoptikum user wants to claim a Persona The single persons can then delegate
If Max now wants to present both podcasts in his Persona "Max", he will delegate the Persona "Max and Moritz" to the Persona "Max". Moritz can do the same with his Persona "Moritz" and the Persona "Max and Moritz".


Personas: Your personas are your different identities when you are podcasting. You might be podcasting in the name of an organisation, a group or use an alias, when you appear contributing to a podcast. We call all these different identities personas.
