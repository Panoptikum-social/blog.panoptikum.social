Thank you for several [recommendations](https://panoptikum.io/recommendations) last year and the first recommendation of 2018.

Panoptikum has currently 232 registered users and those users have written 122
recommendations and gave 1 530 likes. It is clear, that likes are less effort
and are therefore in the majority, but one recommendation per subscribed user
would be great! Please promote your favourite podcast or podcast episode with a
recommendation.

## OPML file and Top 10 podcasts

At the moment about 30 % of the registered users have uploaded an OPML file.

I wonder, if the statistics would change significantly, if all users uploaded
their files...

## Link to persona

You can now find the link(s) to a preview page of your persona(s) after login
under myProfile.

## Tag new-feed-url

The <new-feed-url> tag helps you change your podcast RSS feed address (URL) if
your old hoster does not support a redirect. Just put the tag containig the new
url in your OLD RSS feed.

## Further statistics from Panoptikum (derived today)
* 28 635 podcasts
* 1 734 908 eposides
