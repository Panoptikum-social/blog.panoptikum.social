Two thirds of the Panoptium core team were at the hacker camp [SHA2017](https://sha2017.org/) in Zeewolde in the Netherlands and at [Podstock.de](https://panoptikum.social/podcasts/15527) in Sohrschied in Germany.

Stefan could gather a lot of input and feedback for Panoptikum.

At SHA the Panoptikum API for other clients (such as podcatchers) was heavily discussed with [Martin](https://github.com/mfietz) from [AntennaPod](http://antennapod.org/). The API will meet the specification of [jsonapi](http://jsonapi.org/) and the implementation starts with September. Details will be provided with the [roadmap](https://github.com/PanoptikumIO/pan/projects/2).

At Podstock the idea of the integration of Wiki Data came to life. Check out the post [Datenbankstrukturen](http://andreas-hubel.de/) from Andreas Hubel. If you are interested in the details of data structure in Wiki Data, and speak any German, listen to the podcast edisode that is provided in the post. Long term goal could be a map like the [Podcast Universe](https://muffin.works/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/podcast_universe_map_2015_10.jpg) based on the network of the personas in the Panoptikum database. That map could then be generated automatically on demand and be always up to date.
