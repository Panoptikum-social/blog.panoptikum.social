Watch Stefans Lightning Talk at 33C3 in Hamburg this week.

His talk starts in minute [15](https://media.ccc.de/v/33c3-8089-lightning_talks_day_4#video&t=901) and gives in just three and a half minutes a good intro to Panoptikum.io. Today I received detailed feedback from one of the listeners in Hamburg - thanks again to A.
