# Podcaster Manual

This [Podcaster Manual](/podcaster-manual) describes the use of Panoptikum from the
podcaster perspective. Please read the [Listener Manual](/listener-manual)
before this one to understand what listeners read about your podcast in
Panoptikum. Panoptikum.io uses metadata in the RSS feeds to identify contributors and presents information
regarding those persons. Podcasters, that want to enhance and manage their
automatically generated business cards, can upgrade to a Panoptikum.io
pro-account.

Basis Functionality for Podcasters
* Listing of the podcast at Panoptikum.io in the categories, assigned in the feed
* Episode list with shownotes and integrated player
* Easy subscription of the podcast with subscribe button or QR-code
* Recommendations
* API to retrieve data
* Personas

Panoptikum shows statistics regarding podcasts directly on the page. The API
offers the possibility for podcasters to retrieve data for their own
applications. No information regarding single listeners (besides your own) is 
offered via the API.

WORK IN PROGRESS
