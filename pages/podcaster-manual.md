# Podcaster Manual

This [Podcaster Manual](/podcaster-manual) describes the use of Panoptikum from
the podcaster perspective. Please read the [Listener Manual](/listener-manual)
before this one to understand what listeners read about your podcast in
Panoptikum. Panoptikum.io uses metadata in the RSS feeds to identify contributors
and presents information regarding those persons. Podcasters, that want to enhance
and manage their automatically generated business cards, can upgrade to a Panoptikum
pro-account.

## Functionality Independent from Registration

Basis functionality for podcasters:

* Listing of the podcast at Panoptikum.io in the categories assigned in the feed
* Episode list with shownotes and and integrated player on episode detail page
* Easy subscription to the podcast with subscribe button or QR-code
* Recommendations
* API to retrieve data
* Personas

Panoptikum shows statistics regarding podcasts directly on the page. The API
offers the possibility for podcasters to retrieve data for their own
applications. No information regarding single listeners (besides your own) is
offered via the API.

### Listing of My Podcast

Your podcast gets listed on Panoptikum, if it is included in at least one uploaded
OPML-file of a registered user. You can also add your podcast personally after
registration. Registered users can use the "suggest a podcast" function offered
in the sub menu under your user name. Please see the
[Listener Manual](/listener-manual) for more information regarding registration
and listing of podcasts.

If you want to remove your podcast from Panoptikum please send an email to
<stefan@panoptikum.io>. This is a manual procedure.

### Easy Access to Your Podcast

The listing on Panoptikum gives your podcast the chance to get discovered by
listeners. It can be found based on recommendations, categories and the search
function. With the episode list including shownotes interested listeners get a
good overview of your podcast and its content. The integrated player offers the
fastest way to listen into the podcast and to get the feeling, if the
interested listener and you are tuned on the same wavelength.

The interested listener can become your listener  with the subscribe button
or the QR-code on the page of your podcast on Panoptikum easily.

## General Tips

### Improve Your Podcast Metadata

Panoptikum and other podcast platforms rely on correct metadata of your
podcast. Metadata are those fields in your RSS feed that provide additional
information regarding your podcast and it's episodes.

* Use the matching categories to list your podcast in one or more branches of
the Panoptikum category tree.
* Add the names of all contributors to your feed. Based on the contributors in
your feed Panoptikum automatically generates the persona and adds the gig to an
existing persona.

Check out the documentation of your podcast publishing software to set the
metadata in the best way possible.

### Tipp for Users of Podlove Publisher

To ensure that all contributors are listed in the feed, please use the URI
attribute per contributor.
