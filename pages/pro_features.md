# Pro Features

Users with a Pro Account can claim personas and have access to the following functions (regarding the persona):

* change URL
* change image
* change description
* redirect personas
* delegate personas

### Persona Page URL

The automatically generated persona page has an URL that ends with a PID. A random example [https://panoptikum.io/9e113027-16d7-5534-a6d5-1711c00e822c](https://panoptikum.io/9e113027-16d7-5534-a6d5-1711c00e822c). I find this rather difficult to remember.

So if you want to use the persona page as a showcase of your podcaster portfolio change the URL to something more memorable. Another random example [https://panoptikum.io/waldgruber](https://panoptikum.io/waldgruber). I guess you get the point :-)

### Persona Page Content

You can now find the link(s) to a preview page of your persona(s) after login under myProfile.

**Image**

The default image acts as a placeholder for your personal image. Introduce yourself to listeners with additional visual information, beside your voice from the podcast(s).

**Description**

Write about yourself on your persona page. What should interested listeners know about you?

The text field supports markdown - so you are free to use your creativity describing yourself.

**Delegation and Redirection**

The possibilty to edit the presented information on the persona page helps to overcome the hurl of incomplete feed data. Not all podcast producers name all contributors in each episode or if several people own a podcast together, the feed lists them together.

* Delegation: A delegation lets the gigs (i.e. contributions to episodes) and engagements (i.e. contributions to podcasts) of the persona also appear on the profile page of the target persona.
* Redirection: The redirection redirects the persona profile page to the profile page of the target persona.

For more details information regarding personas please check out the blog post [User Self Service](https://blog.panoptikum.io/2017/01/29/user-self-service.html#04b2080f).
