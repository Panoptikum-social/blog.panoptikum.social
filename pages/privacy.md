## Cookies

This documentation website blog.panoptikum.io uses no cookies

Panoptikum uses a cookie to identify your session. It is called `_pan_key` and signed to be prevented
from tampering. It contains the session, mostly a CSRF token and your `user_id`, in case you are
logged in to be able to check, that you and only your browser sent the data.

Sessions are not stored on the server, so by deleting the cookie in your browser,
all facts about your session are gone and you will have to login again.


## Tokens

API access is not handled via cookies, but with signed tokens, which only contain your `user_id`


## Registration

During the registration you will be asked for an email address (required for password recovery), an
user name (used for your reviews, comments and likes) and a password (for login). You can choose
any user name as long as it has not been taken yet within Panoptikum.


## Collected Data

Beside the information provided during registration, Panoptikum.io uses your uploaded subscription
list (OPML file) to add podcasts to the Panoptikum.io podcast list. It stores and publishes that
you are a subscriber of the podcast. Panoptikum.io stores and pulishes your reviews, comments and
likes.


## Data access self service

A data access self service is implemented. Registered users can manage their
data stored at Panoptikum after the log in with the function My Data.
My Data opens the page Account and offers all your data as a JSON-File with a
Download button and shows you all your stored data. You can check what is stored
the different areas and delete it per area. In the area itself you can either
delete all entries or just individual entries. You find more information in the
[Listener Manual](/listener-manual). 


## Your Rights

You have the right of information, correction, deletion, restriction
transfer, cancellation and protest on principle. If you believe, that the
processing of your data does not adhere to data privacy laws or your
privacy demands are refused in any kind, you can complain at the local
controlling institution. In Austria, this is
[Datenschutzbeh√∂rde](https://www.dsb.gv.at/).
