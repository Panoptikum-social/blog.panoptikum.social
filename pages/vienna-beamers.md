# Vienna BEAMers

Vienna BEAMers is the in ~~person~~ online (due to the Corona pandemic) meetup and study group for
people interested and/or coding in Elixir and Phoenix. We meet every two weeks at Stefan's
self hosted Jitsi Server https://floridsdorf.mittenin.at/vienna-beamers . Nothing is recorded,
comments in the chat are deleted, when the last person leaves the room.

The next meetups are

* **#47 January 28th 2021**
* **#48 February 11th 2021**
* **#49 February 25 2021**

each starting at 18:30 and lasting until 20:00 at most. You won't be kicked out, though ;-)

There are no prerequesites besides showing up with a notebook and some interest in one of the
languages, that run on the BEAM. We have also enthusiasts for Erlang, Lisp-Flavoured Erlang & Joxa
within our group.

We try to be nice to each other and follow the [Berlin Code of Conduct](http://berlincodeofconduct.org/).

## Where does the name Vienna BEAMers come from?

BEAM is the name of the Erlang virtual machine, on which Elixir is running, and we are an in person
meetup in Vienna, Austria.

The name was invented by Dave [@dch__](https://twitter.com/dch__), who has run
a meetup group with this name for years and is the human being behind
[@viennaBEAMers](https://twitter.com/viennaBEAMers).

Dave is probably the most experienced developer in our group -
ask him a question, and he will be happy to prove it :-)
