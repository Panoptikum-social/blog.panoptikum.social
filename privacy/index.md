Q: What happens with the information (user registration, subscription list) I provide?

A: Panoptikum tries to ask (and save) only information that is required to offer the service. It does not intend to collect demographic data or to identify single persons. During the registration you will be asked for an email address (required for password recovery), an user name (used for your reviews, comments and likes) and a password (for login). You can choose any user name as long as it has not ben taken yet within Panoptikum. Panoptikum will use your uploaded subscription list to add podcasts to the Panoptikum podcast list and store that you are a subscriber. Panoptikum will store your reviews, comments and likes.
